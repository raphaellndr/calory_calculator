# Calory calculator

This project is a small Flutter project which goal is to calculate, given few personal information, your daily calories need. I coded it when following this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-dart-creez-des-applications-pour-ios-et-android/).

## Getting started

Bellow are the instructions to run the project on your own personal device.

### Install the project

You can either download it directly from Github or clone it. To clone it, go where you want to install this app on your computer, open a command prompt in this folder and run :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/raphaellndr/calory_calculator.git
```

(note : if you don't have Git, [install it](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).

### Install Flutter

To install this app on your device (whether it is an Android emulator or not), you will need your have Flutter on your computer. If you don't, simply install it by following the [official tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Run the project

Once you did everything right, simply plug your phone into your computer or start an Android emulator, and run this command in a terminal :

```
$ flutter run
```

That's it ! You're done with this short installation and you can now freely discover your daily calories need.
